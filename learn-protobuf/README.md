  <p align="center">
    This project demonstrates the usage of Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) with Go. Protobuf is a language-neutral, platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data, often used for communication between services or for storing data in a compact format.

#### ðŸš€ Key Features
1. Protobuf Definition
    - Includes .proto files that define structured data formats.
    - Demonstrates creating Protobuf message definitions.

2. Protobuf Compilation
    - Shows how to compile .proto files using the protoc compiler to generate Go files.
    - Likely uses the protoc-gen-go plugin for Go code generation.

3. Serialization and Deserialization:
    - Provides examples of encoding data into Protobuf format and decoding it back.
    - Highlights the efficiency of Protobuf in data handling compared to other serialization methods like JSON or XML.

4. Integration with Go:
    - Implements a Go program to work with the generated Protobuf files.
    - Demonstrates integrating Protobuf with Go projects for structured data handling.
